THIS IS MILES JOHNSON'S MISSION STATEMENT

I am learning how to code so I can get a job in the industry, make a hugely succesful wealthy app, and have an opportunistic future. I want to see myself develop and grow. In addition, find a craft I love and hone my skills in it and master it. I want to make coding that craft.
